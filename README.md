Captcha Generator

The Captcha Generator project is a fun and educational web development project where I built a simple CAPTCHA system. The system generates a random sequence of characters (letters and numbers) that the user needs to input correctly in an input field to verify the CAPTCHA. If the user correctly inputs the characters, a success message appears, otherwise, the user is prompted to try again.

This project helped me understand basic CAPTCHA functionality and enhanced my skills in front-end web development.
