Captcha Generator 🔒🔢

The Captcha Generator project is a fun and educational web development task where I built a simple CAPTCHA system. The system generates a random sequence of characters (letters and numbers) that the user needs to input correctly to verify the CAPTCHA.

If the user enters it correctly, a success message appears ✅. If not, the user is prompted to try again 🔁.

This project helped me understand basic CAPTCHA functionality and enhanced my skills in front-end web development.
